# Network Traffic Threat Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict potential **security threats** in network traffic by analyzing pre-recorded data. Using machine learning techniques, the model processes historical network traffic data to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of cyber threats.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares network traffic data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts relevant attributes for model training.
- **Threat Prediction**: Uses a trained model to classify network traffic as normal or malicious.
- **Visualization**: Provides insights into network behavior through graphs and charts.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses the accuracy and effectiveness of the predictive model.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-Learn** (for machine learning models)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (for numerical computing)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for data visualization)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-threat-prediction.git
   cd network-threat-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the prediction script:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input data/sample_traffic.csv
   ```

## Usage
- Prepare network traffic data in CSV format.
- Run the prediction script to analyze traffic and identify potential threats.
- Review the results and visualization outputs in the `results/` directory.
